# Final-Fantasy-XIV-Gearing-Spreadsheet

##Overview
A personal project of mine to create a spreadsheet in Google Sheets that allows me to keep track of my gear and weapons, and automatically updates sheet-wide, calculating other resources, when I update a class' gear pieces.

## Project Goals
As I like to gear up every class I can in this game, I needed my spreadsheet to be able to keep track of the 8 typical gearsets that can be built for each role, so I set that as a goal. Also, I wanted the spreadsheet to automatically update whenever I input that I got a new piece of gear, so by using cross-sheet referencing, updating a value in the best in slot columns in the related role sheet (the columns who's headers are purple), it automatically fills in the larger sheet which helps me to keep track of my overall progress. This page is then also calculated upon, and worked into manipulating the title page, which gives me a quick overview of my progress, what's left to get, and my relic weapon progress per class. I also aimed to use conditional formatting to colour code the whole sheet, to make it easily digestible, and straightforward to understand.

## Tools and Technologies Used, as well as Strong Points
### Google Sheets
- Cross-sheet referencing to aid in automated updating across the workbook
- Conditional formatting used to make the spreadsheet look aesthetically appealing
- Complex formulas such as multiple length IFS statements and others seen below:
